# OAuth2 Device Flow (LAB)

This is an experimental Python script for OAuth2 device flow tryouts.

## Preparation

You need to have access on an authorization server which supports the device flow. I ran tests with [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/settings/developers).

Some dependencies are required which can be easily installed with `pipenv`:

```shell
$ pipenv install

To activate this project's virtualenv, run pipenv shell.
Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.
```

## Usage

First exchange the client id and the authorization server endpoints in the script.

Then simply run it and follow the instructions printed on the console. As a result you should see a valid access token which can be used, now.

```shell
$ python device_flow.py
